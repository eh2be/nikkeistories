          <p>For well over a century, Japanese Canadians, one of the nation's smallest minority groups, played a defining role in what it means to be Canadian. They laboured in sawmills, mines, and canneries, excelled as fishermen and farmers, and even dominated baseball until the government forced the entire population of 22,000 men, women, and children to be dispersed and assimilated into the Canadian melting pot. These Canadian Nikkei persisted for decades to transcend racism, surmount discriminatory government policies, rise out of poverty, twice, and win an unprecedented Redress settlement in asserting what most Canadians take for granted: their citizenship rights.</p>

          <p>The stories of the people, places, vic6ories and losses that describe the dramatic Japanese Canadian are brought to life in Nikkei Stories; a collection of short films accessible on location and on demand via your smartphone or computer.</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/2009-15-4-4.jpg"></p>
        <p>
        <strong>1833</strong>  First recorded instance of Japanese shipwrecks off the west coast of what would become British Columbia. 
          
        <strong>1842</strong>  Ranald MacDonald, son of an aboriginal woman and white man, travels to Japan in search of people like himself, after seeing castaway Japanese sailors off the coast of British Columbia. 

        <strong>1854</strong>  Japan establishes diplomatic relations with the West and ends period of self imposed isolation by signing treaty with U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry.

        <strong>1868</strong>  The Meiji Restoration is responsible for the emergence of Japan as a modernized nation, but causes poverty by raising taxes and enforces conscription into the newly formed Imperial Army.

        <strong>1877</strong>  Manzo Nagano, age 22, leaves Yokohama and lands in New Westminster, BC, the first Japanese person known to land and settle in Canada.
        <a href=" ">PHOTO:NNM 1994-85-1_Manzo Nagano and family_Victoria BC 1911"</a>

        <strong>1879</strong>  Steveston becomes a municipality.

        <strong>1882</strong>  Thirteen canneries operate on the Fraser River with Phoenix Cannery being the first on the Steveston waterfront, built between No. 1 Road and No. 2 Road. 

        <strong>1883</strong>  Tomekichi Homma, an educated son of a former samurai, settles in Steveston and begins fishing with other early Japanese immigrants.<a href="">1b TOMEKICHI-PORTRAIT (Note: This is the portrait of Homma as a youngish man)</a>
