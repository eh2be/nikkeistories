        <strong>1883</strong>  Tomekichi Homma, an educated son of a former samurai, settles in Steveston and begins fishing with other early Japanese immigrants.

        Takezo (surname unknown) is the first Japanese immigrant employed at the Hastings Sawmill in Vancouver, later the largest employer of Japanese immigrants in Canada.

        <strong>1884</strong>  Manzo Nagano travels back to Japan, then returns to North America and settles in Seattle, where he set up a tobacco and restaurant business.

        <strong>1886</strong>  Yoshizawa Yasukichi is the first boss hired to supervise the Japanese Canadian work force at Hastings Sawmill. 
          
        <strong>1887</strong>  Kuno Gihei, a Japanese fisherman impressed by the abundance of salmon in the Fraser River, returns to his village of Mio in Wakayama Prefecture to recruit fellow fishermen, beginning the flow to immigrants from Mio to Steveston.
          
        Yoko Oya is the first Japanese woman to settle in Canada <a href="http://vimeo.com/32071937" class="video-link" style="outline:none"><img class=playIcon src="/assets/Play_25.png"></a> and with her husband, Washiji Oya, opens the first general store to serve the Nikkei community at 457 Powell Street.
